# Changelog

What a reader of this repository would notice, in the group it belongs
to: what changed, why, and what it cost. There are no release notes for
this file to be the record behind: `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s *A version, and
no release* has why, and what the `## Unreleased` heading becomes.

The record starts here. `v0.1.0` was tagged before this file existed and
nothing is reconstructed for it: a changelog written backwards from a git
log is a guess at what somebody would have noticed, and there is no way
to check the guess.

## Unreleased

### The root files are the organization's, and the tree says which

- **`RELEASING.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` are gone, and what the first
  said that is worth keeping is where a contributor reads.** Section 2
  of btclib-org/.github's README says a tier-2 repository carries neither
  (btclib-org/.github#150): the first opened *There is no release, and no
  machinery for one* in a tree with a release page on `v0.1.0`, and the
  second had nothing to be on top of, its one section reading *Nothing
  to act on*. What stays — that nothing is on the index and what anybody
  runs is a checkout of `main`, that a tag is signed and `tag-integrity`
  refuses one that is not, that `## Unreleased` becomes the version and
  a tag can be deleted and re-cut only while nothing is published — is
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s *A version, and no release*, under *This repository
  in particular*. The list of what a release waits on is not carried
  over: section 2 weighed a procedure kept ready for a release that may
  come and decided that it arrives with `release.yml` the day it does.
  `README.md`'s pointer to the release notes is a line saying there is
  no release, `REPOSITORY.md`'s *No publishing* bullet cites that section
  where it cited `RELEASING.md`, and this file's introduction stops
  naming a record it is behind. The entry below that lists the two files
  among those arriving describes the tree between that landing and this
  one. `.gitattributes` keeps `RELEASE_NOTES.md merge=union`: section 14
  of the standard owes the two `merge=union` entries to every copy, and
  an attribute on a path the tree does not hold is inert.

- **`CONTRIBUTING.md` and `REVIEWING.md` are the same file as every
  sibling's down to `## This repository in particular`.** Section 14 of
  btclib-org/.github is what says so and `tests/verbatim_test.py` there
  is what compares the bytes. What each said in this tree's own words
  about rules that are the organization's — the tracker, the prose
  style, the pull request, the review, the landing — is gone, a second
  wording being the copy that goes stale; what is under the marker is
  what only this tree can say.

- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `AUTHORS.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `REPOSITORY.md`,
  `RELEASING.md`, `CHANGELOG.md` and `RELEASE_NOTES.md` arrive**, which
  is most of issue #34. `AUTHORS.md` points at this repository's own
  contributor graph rather than a sibling's. `SECURITY.md` says what is
  this node's to answer for as against btclib's and Bitcoin Core's, and
  gives an address because private vulnerability reporting is off here
  (#136). `REPOSITORY.md` is every setting read back from the endpoint,
  including the one that says no status check is required (#88 of
  btclib-org/.github).

- **`.markdownlint.jsonc`, `.yamllint.yaml`, `.taplo.toml` and
  `LICENSE` are byte-for-byte the organization's copies**, this having
  been the one repository where the three configurations still differed.
  `.yamllint.yaml` is the one that changes behaviour: it extends the
  default set where this copy listed two rules and extended nothing, so
  indentation, trailing whitespace and duplicate keys were unchecked
  under a gate that passed for having nothing to check, and
  `document-start` moves from a warning the hook exits 0 on to an error.
  No tracked yaml file here trips the wider set. `LICENSE` gains its
  `MIT License` title and loses the year range that `COPYRIGHT` has
  never carried.

- **`CLAUDE.md` holds what no document written for a human can** — the
  architecture, the worktree rule, the model, the facts that otherwise
  cost a session. The environment and the gates moved to
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s last section, a human having no reason to open an
  agent's file to learn how to run one.

- **`.gitattributes` marks the two new record files `merge=union`.** It
  was empty; without those lines every branch appending a bullet would
  conflict on the insertion point, which is a conflict with nothing to
  decide.

- **`README.md` points at those files rather than repeating them.** It
  carried the install, test and lint commands, which are now
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`'s last section: two copies of a command are two
  things to keep in step, and the one a contributor reads is the one CI
  runs.

### `.pydeps` and the dependency that read it are gone

- **Nothing ran `pydeps`.** The configuration file was in the tree and
  the package was in the `test` dependency group, and no hook, workflow,
  script or test invoked either — `grep -rn pydeps` named the two of
  them and nothing else. A tool that only a person can remember to run
  is not a gate, and its configuration is a file a reader has to account
  for.

### `macos.yml` is `os-macos.yml`

- **The platform sweeps carry a prefix that groups them.** The file is
  renamed, its `name:` key with it; the job name is untouched, a check
  being keyed by name alone and bound outside the tree. Nothing in the
  repository refers to the old path.

### `scripts/` was in the mypy gate's own configuration, and never in the gate

- **The pre-commit hook passed `btclib_node tests` on its command line,
  which overrides `[tool.mypy]`'s `files` rather than agreeing with
  it** — mypy reads `files` only when given no paths of its own. `files`
  named `scripts` and said so in a comment; the gate never checked it,
  the same shape of defect `.yamllint.yaml`'s entry above records for a
  config that extended nothing. The hook now passes no paths, so `files`
  is the one list both a bare `mypy` and the gate read, and cannot drift
  from each other again. The stale per-flag error counts the same
  `[tool.mypy]` block carried are replaced with the command that
  re-derives them: a count is a line every branch touching that block
  has to keep true, and this one had already gone false.

### The build backend is `uv_build`, and what the sdist carries is declared

- **`setuptools.build_meta` becomes `uv_build`**, pinned
  `>=0.12.5,<0.13`; `[tool.setuptools.packages.find]` goes with it, and
  `module-root = ""` is what now says the package sits at the root.
  btclib-org/.github#118 is where a pure-Python project was decided onto
  that backend, and btclib is the tree the pin comes from. The property
  the floor is about — the sdist's own `pyproject.toml` being a
  normalized copy with the verbatim one beside it as
  `pyproject.toml.orig` — arrives in `0.12.0`, so the pin sits above that
  boundary rather than on it: `0.12.5` is the uv this tree is gated
  against, being the rev `.pre-commit-config.yaml` pins for
  `uv-pre-commit`. `[build-system]` carries the command that locates the
  boundary, and why `uv build` is not it.

- **What the sdist holds is stated for the first time.** There was no
  `MANIFEST.in`, so the archive was whatever setuptools defaulted to and
  nothing had declared it — and what it left out was the suite, and every
  configuration file of the lint gate that is a file of its own.
  `pyproject.toml` went, so the tools reading their settings from it were
  served and the hooks keeping a file of their own were not.
  `[tool.uv.build-backend]` `source-include` now names the root prose,
  `scripts/`, `tests/`, `uv.lock`, `.python-version` and the
  configuration each hook keeps. `.github/` is left out as a decision and
  not because anything refuses it: adding `.github/**` ships the
  directory and `check-sdist` still reports the archive as matching git,
  that tool's default ignore list suppressing a report rather than
  governing what is packed.

- **The archive is not a tree the gate runs on**, which the include list
  raises and does not settle: `git init` in an unpacked sdist followed by
  `pre-commit run --all-files` exits 1 at `check-hooks-apply`, and that
  run names the hooks left with no file to read. Shipping `.github/` does
  not change the verdict — the same run still exits 1, on the hooks whose
  files are the workspaces `[tool.check-sdist]` keeps back.

### The review check is red on anything but an ack of its head

- **`claude-review.yml` reads the verdict the review posted, and fails
  on anything but an `ACK` naming the pull request's head.** The one
  guard it had tested whether the action had started, and that was the
  whole of the check's colour: on pull request 164 the run for
  `4da7fba`, a sha the review answered `CHANGES REQUESTED`, concluded
  `success`. The step is btclib-org/.github's, taken from its
  `claude-review.yml` at `18e6c64` with the comment that carries its
  measurement; btclib-org/.github#146 is the finding across the
  organization. Still not a required check, for the reason the file's
  header gives.

### Two root files are the organization's, and no longer this tree's

- **`CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` is gone.** It pointed at the PSF code of
  conduct, as the one copy in btclib-org/.github does, and GitHub shows
  that copy for a public repository that has none of its own: a copy per
  repository is a copy of a pointer, which is why section 14 of the
  standard no longer lists the file (btclib-org/.github#123).

- **`SECURITY.md` is gone, and its *Limitations* are in `README.md`.**
  The policy a tree keeps is the one that travels in its sdist, and this
  repository publishes nothing for one to travel with, so what GitHub
  shows is the organization's (btclib-org/.github#116). What that policy
  cannot say for this node — the JSON-RPC listener on `0.0.0.0`
  authenticating nothing, #27, and what a peer may ask for not being
  bounded by what asking costs it, #101 — is under its own heading in
  `README.md`, which is where somebody about to run the node reads.
  `RELEASING.md`, `REPOSITORY.md` and the issue template's contact link
  pointed at the file, and now point at the policy shown here.

- **The wheel carries the same members**, less `top_level.txt`, which is
  setuptools' own legacy metadata rather than something the wheel
  specification asks for. The member *lists* are what is unchanged; the
  metadata files themselves are rewritten by the new generator, gaining
  a field as well as losing one — `METADATA` gains an `Author:` beside
  the `Author-email:` setuptools emitted alone, drops the `Dynamic:
  license-file` setuptools added, and reorders the rest, while `WHEEL`
  names `uv` where it named `setuptools` and `RECORD` is reordered. A
  `diff` over the two unpacked `dist-info` directories is what shows it,
  and no summary here stands in for that. What is unchanged is what the
  wheel installs: every `.py` is byte-identical, `RECORD` giving each the
  same hash and length as before. To re-derive either archive, build in a
  checkout of the commit before this one and in one of this commit:

  ```shell
  uv build -o dist                                   # in each checkout
  diff <(tar tzf <old>/dist/*.tar.gz | sed 's|^[^/]*/||;s|/$||' | sort -u) \
       <(tar tzf <new>/dist/*.tar.gz | sed 's|^[^/]*/||;s|/$||' | sort -u)
  diff <(unzip -Z1 <old>/dist/*.whl | grep -v '/$' | sort) \
       <(unzip -Z1 <new>/dist/*.whl | grep -v '/$' | sort)
  ```

  The directory members are dropped there because the two backends record
  them differently: setuptools ends an sdist's with a slash where the uv
  backend does not, and the uv backend writes them into the wheel where
  setuptools writes none. That is a difference in how the archive is
  recorded and not in what it carries.

- **`check-sdist` joins the lint gate**, which is the first thing here to
  ask what is tracked and not in the archive, and what is in the archive
  and not tracked. It reads `[tool.uv.build-backend]` for the uv backend,
  so an exclusion there is not reported again; `[tool.check-sdist]`
  `git-only` holds what no include pattern adds — the workspaces of an
  editor and of an agent, the files git reads, and `COPYRIGHT`, which
  btclib-org/.github#135 argues is a repository file rather than a
  distributed one.

### Every signature in `btclib_node`, `tests` and `scripts` is annotated

- **`disallow_untyped_defs`, `disallow_untyped_calls` and
  `disallow_incomplete_defs` join `[tool.mypy]`'s enabled bundle, and
  `explicit-override` joins `enable_error_code`** — the four #104 was
  the annotation pass for, each measured at zero over `files` before
  being turned on. Annotating a signature is what most of it took;
  where a test built a `SimpleNamespace` in place of a real class, the
  fix is one of three named patterns and not a fourth invented per
  call site — `cast` where a production constructor is handed the
  double, `Any` where the double is never handed to one, a local
  `Protocol` where several callers share a narrower shape than the
  real class has. Annotating `btclib_node/db.py`'s `_rows` surfaced
  that its return type was narrower than the `PRAGMA` queries already
  run through it; `Config.log_path` was declared `str` where its own
  `__init__` treats a falsy value as "no file logging" and every
  `scripts/chains/*.py` script relies on exactly that. Both are
  widened rather than worked around. `no_implicit_reexport` and
  `check_untyped_defs` are untouched by this pass and stay off for the
  reasons `[tool.mypy]`'s own comments give.

### An RPC connection is forgotten once its answer is sent

- **`RpcManager.connections` no longer grows for the life of the node**
  (#64). Every request opened a connection, `async_send` answered it and
  closed its socket, and the entry stayed in the dict anyway: measured
  on `origin/main` before this change, a run of eleven requests against
  a running node left `len(connections)` at 11 and climbing, never
  smaller. The removal was already written into `rpc/main.py`, commented
  out at the end of `handle_rpc`; restoring it is the whole of the fix,
  placed after the answer is sent on both paths -- after `send_and_wait`
  for `stop`, after `send` otherwise.
- **`RpcManager.remove_connection` is deleted rather than repaired.** It
  called `.stop()` on a `Connection`, which has no such method (`close()`
  is what it defines), and nothing had ever called it. Wiring it up in
  `handle_rpc`'s place would have called `Connection.close()` -- which
  closes the socket synchronously, from `Node`'s own thread -- while the
  still-scheduled `async_send` on `RpcManager`'s event loop thread can be
  mid-write on the fire-and-forget `send()` path that never waits for
  it: a cross-thread race that can cut an answer off before it reaches
  the client. The restored line only forgets the dict entry; the socket
  is closed by `async_send` itself, on the thread already writing to it.
  `btclib_node/p2p/manager.py` keeps its own `remove_connection`, which
  is safe for the same reason this one was not: it is only ever called
  from inside its own manager's event loop, not across threads.
- The RPC port binds every interface with no authentication (#27), so
  this was a leak any client could drive, not only an internal
  bookkeeping detail.

### `no_implicit_reexport` is on: every import names where a name is defined

- **`TxIn`, `TxOut` and `OutPoint` were imported from a module that only
  passes them through.** `TxIn` and `TxOut` came from `btclib.tx.tx`,
  which imports them for its own use and defines neither; `OutPoint`
  came from `btclib.tx.tx_in` the same way. `btclib` already answers
  this correctly at its package boundary -- `btclib.tx`'s own
  `__init__.py` re-exports all three explicitly, `__all__` and all --
  the gap was entirely on this side, every affected import redirected
  to where each name is actually defined: `OutPoint` in
  `btclib.tx.out_point`, `TxIn` in `btclib.tx.tx_in`, `TxOut` in
  `btclib.tx.tx_out`. `uv run --locked --no-default-groups --group lint
  --group test mypy --strict` is clean where it was not before.
- **`no_implicit_reexport` moves into the enabled bundle** -- the last
  of the flags `[tool.mypy]`'s comments had left off pending this fix,
  `check_untyped_defs` (#105) being the one still open.
